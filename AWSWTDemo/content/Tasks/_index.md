These tasks were thinking of to demo some features of using FortiGate with gateway load balancer, but you can think in other tests.

Feel free to explore the AWS routing tables, check TGW configuration, etc. If you have suggestions for other labs, that are not here or you don't have permission to do it, please write a comment in the same Sharepoint page you got the credentials.

There is no specific order to perform the tasks.
